            MetaCars is a Token + NFT + Metaverse Game inspired by the cartoon
            Cars. When we were children we all watched the cartoon Cars, but now
            is the time to make our dream reality by creating a community of car
            enthusiasts. MetaCars is a proprietary, hyper deflationary token on
            the Binance Smart Chain network. MetaCars is not just a regular
            token, it's a token that collects all cartoon cars lovers in one
            community. Moreover, it offers them different kinds of NFTs to be
            used in Metaverse and the carton cars are converted into a Metaverse
            GAME.{' '}
